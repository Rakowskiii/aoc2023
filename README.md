# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)! This collection contains my code for each day's challenges. All feedback is welcome.

## Solutions

Each day's folder contains two parts of the challenge. A ⭐️ indicates completion of part 1, while a 🌟 signifies that part 2 is also complete.

- **Day 1**: [Solution](/day1) 🌟


## Utils
This lib will grow over time with code that will be useful on multiple days. Will later be converted into aoc-utils for future yeas.
